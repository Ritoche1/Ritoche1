## About Me
I am currently a 5th-year student at Epitech, specializing in Computer Science. I previously pursued a Management Certificate at McGill University, Montreal, as part of my year abroad. This unique blend of technology and management education equips me with the skills to lead tech projects and teams effectively. Additionally, I am currently working at SNCF, where I contribute to various impactful projects using Power Platform and PCF development.

## What Iâ€™m currently working on
- **SNCF**: Contributing to impactful tech projects aimed at improving transportation systems and services.
- **Epitech Projects**: Collaborating on diverse tech projects ranging from software development to system administration.
- **Echo**: Revolutionizing the way we share music with friends through Echo. Our application lets you connect your Spotify listening activities to create a shared musical experience, no matter where you are. Lead a music session by sharing your favorite tracks, or join friends and explore their musical tastes. Echo synchronizes your streams, letting you share the vibe together. Initially started as an Epitech Innovation Project (EIP), Echo is currently under active development. [Learn more about Echo](https://echo-app.fr/)
